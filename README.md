## Abstract
In the Linux world, there are many ways that you can setup and configure your systems.  There are at least 10 configuration orchestration tools out there.  To name a few: ansible, cfengine, pupper, chef, salt and many others.  

When I first started learning Linux, I did  my configuration with bash scripts + ssh.  Then I crank up to cfengine, and try out  puppet master.  Finally, I ended up playing with ansible and living with it since then.  

In this 20-30 minutes talk, I will share my ansible journey, from shell to galaxy.  

## whoami
I was known as "Tan Ser Heang" for the good old 40+ years, but here in Australia I am known as "Ser Henag TAN", and sometimes people called me "Sir" (Ser) too.  I am not knighted (yet), so you can call me by my lastname "TAN".  
I had been playing with PC (games) since 1990, and been living, learning and loving Linux since the millenium (Y2K).  I don't consider myself Linux Expert, but I am fascinated with Linux and how it had changed ans shaped the (IT) world.  
1 of my life goal is to automate myself out of (repetitive) jobs :D

Here is a placeholder for the shell scripts, ansible playbooks/roles and Vagrantfile that I used in my talk.
