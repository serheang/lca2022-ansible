# Playtime with configuration: from bash to galaxy

## Abstract
In the Linux world, there is many ways that you can setup and configure your systems.  There is at least 10 configuration orchestration tools out there.  To name a few: ansible, cfengine, pupper, chef, salt and many others.
When I first started learning Linux, I did  my configuration with bash scripts + ssh.  Then I move up to cfengine, and did some puppet.  Finally, I ended up playing with ansible.
This is my ansible journey, from bash, ad-hoc to roles and galaxy.
