# Playtime with configuration: from shell to galaxy

## Abstract
In the Linux world, there are many ways that you can setup and configure your systems.  There are at least 10 configuration orchestration tools out there.  To name a few: ansible, cfengine, pupper, chef, salt and many others.  

When I first started learning Linux, I did  my configuration with bash scripts + ssh.  Then I crank up to cfengine, and try out  puppet master.  Finally, I ended up playing with ansible and living with it since then.  

In this 20-30 minutes talk, I will share my ansible journey, from shell to galaxy.  

## More info
Here is a placeholder for the shell scripts, ansible playbooks/roles and Vagrantfile that I used in my talk.
